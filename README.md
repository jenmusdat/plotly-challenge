# plotly-challenge

For this challenge we were asked to complete our first Dashboard using plotly. Dashboards are very popular with C suite executives and there some great real world examples for this. At the hospital where I work the corporate office is quite proud of their dashboards. As I was working on this assignment I referred to some of the dashboards I see everyday to get an idea on the code used internally to create these dashboards.
This is an exmaple of what you will see when you look at the webpage.
